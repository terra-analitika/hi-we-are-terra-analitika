# terra-analitika

We are a group of geoscience and data science enthusiasts consisting of alumni and students of Geophysics of Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia. `terra-analitika` dreams of being the think tank for computational geoscience in Indonesia that runs on the wonders of data science, machine learning, cloud computation, and more. There are lots of projects that together we can build here to promote programming skills for young geoscientists (geophysicists, geologists, & reservoir) through Google Colab. `terra-analitika` is an open community for all geoscientists all over Indonesia. From oil & gas exploration to disaster prevention to speech recognition, you are free to code everything. **Join and code with us!**

Make Python "down to earth" ðŸŒŽ for young geoscientists. Made in Indonesia & Made for Indonesia. 

Best, 

Nuwara
