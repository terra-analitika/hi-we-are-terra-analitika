We are a group of geoscience and data science enthusiasts consisting of alumni and students of Geophysics of Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia. terra-analitika dreams of being the think tank for computational geoscience in Indonesia that runs on the wonders of data science, machine learning, cloud computation, and more. There are lots of projects that we build here to promote programming skills for young geoscientists (geophysicists, geologists, & reservoir) through Google Colab. **Join and code with us!**
